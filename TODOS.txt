1. figure out how containers communicate with one another (it's something about localhost)
2. databases in each container are separate (not shared) -> can we use volume to solve this? 
  - using the same volume names in each container won't do it
  - Yes we can use docker volumes to solve this: https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/
  - Can we create volume in docker-compose or do we have to create them before docker-compose
  - read docker compose volume: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/07-volumes/
3. connect to Redis from Stats (see fastapi-redis)
