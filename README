Initialize the Answers.db and WordList.db databases:
    - WordList.db contains the valid five-letter words
    - Answers.db contains the answers and their word_id
- run:  bin/init.sh

Install traefik in the root folder of project

Initialize stats.db database:
- create a database with 1 million stats and 100k users
- run: python3 bin/stats.py
- NOTE: this will create a ./var/stats.db file which the program uses, 
    if you have a ./var/sqlite3-populated.db file, please change it to ./var/stats.db
    The program won't work without ./var/stats.db
Shard the database into 1 users and 3 games shards with uuid as PRIMARY KEY:
- run: python3 bin/shard.py
Start traefik reverse proxy/load balancing:
- run: ./traefik --configFile=traefik.toml
Run the Procfile with 3 users stats service, 1 check and 1 validate service:
- run: foreman start -m 'stats=3,check=1,validate=1,play=1'

The services and their documentation are located at the following addresses:
- stats: localhost:9000/api/v1/
- check: localhost:9100/api/v1/
- validate: localhost:9200/api/v1/
- play: localhost:9300/api/v1/

Using the API
- The best way to see how the API works is with the automatic documentation provided by FastAPI
- Navigate to the microservice using the link provided by foreman in a browser
- add '/docs' after the link in browser 
- The available functions are listed along with the required parameters 
- You can enter some values to see what gets returned for each function

  
There are 2 microservices:
WordValidation
- Validate a word against a database of valid words
- Add a valid word to database
- Remove a word from database of valid words

WordCheck
- Check a word against the answer
- Change the answer of a game

Project 3:
New microservice added:
Stats
- Posts a win or loss for a particular game along with timestamp and number of guesses
- Retrieving the statistics for a user
- Retrieving top 10 users by number of wins
- Retrieving top 10 users by longest streak
